# Face Recognition using Siamese Networks

This project demonstrates face recognition using Siamese Networks, specifically designed for NTI students from the AI track. The Siamese Network model is trained to learn the facial features of individuals and classify whether two faces belong to the same person or not.

## Acknowledgments

This project is inspired by the concept of Siamese Networks for face recognition. The implementation and structure of the project are adapted to suit the specific needs of NTI students from the AI track.

## Disclaimer

This project is developed for educational purposes and may require further customization and optimization for production use. The accuracy and performance of the face recognition system may vary depending on the quality and diversity of the training dataset.
